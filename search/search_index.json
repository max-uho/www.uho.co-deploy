This exhibition was to be part of cycle called Installation In Situ. Past events of this cycle were installations produced by architects or artists. We were not at ease with the idea of producing an installation. Clearly, we position ourselves as architects and tend to feel anxious about flirting with the proximity to artistic production. After a few weeks punctuated by discussions with friends, mainly architects and artists, it became clear that, in the context of a gallery hosted by an architecture school, the involvement of the students in the production of the exhibition was an imperative for our project. We asked ourselves if it would be possible to establish, in place of a static installation that would have stayed there for a month, a series of workshops during the time of the exhibition. In other words: \u201ca school in the school\u201d. Redirecting With this idea in hand, we set out to contact several colleagues and submit the idea. The proposal was arranged around a few key principles: The school would be absolutely free and open to any student of any age and qualification The professors would not be paid The students would not get credits from attending the talks or workshops It was up to the professors to define what and how they would teach To our surprise, everyone we contacted was willing to play along, and we soon had a board of 27 international speakers. These professors were mainly representative of an emerging generation of architects, but also artists and curators. This generation is one interested in fundamental questions surrounding architectural practice, mainly on political, social, historical and theoretical grounds.","title":"2013 Le Terrain"},{"location":"Case_Studies/2014_00_Venice_Islands/","text":"Year 2014 Location Venice, Italy Architects UHO Type Open competition Category Urbanism Diagnosis and prediction Venice, because of its overwhelming touristic activity, cannot simply be the City of its permanent residents. We have to consider tourists as integral citizens, be it for the time they spend here. Venice is an ever- morphing cosmopolis. Our project addresses this issue. Let us start by describing this set of islands. As most of Venice, they are man-made. They are the work of humanity modelling its environment. They are, if a distinction can still be made, the opposite of Nature: they are Culture. Because of this fact, the first fetishization falls. They can never be considered as virgin. They are History, they are the State, the spotlight of public debate has rendered them unclaimable by autonomists. They can no longer be \u201cPirate Utopias\u201d. 1 Now for the conflict: two parties oppose. Two economical entities fight over the property of this piece of land. At first, one might see them as champions of good and evil. On one side, the evil capitalist millionaire, on the other, the spontaneous uprising of the people in the form of the good association. One can picture these two opposing figures as the fat white male smoking a cigar against the popular mob of heroes. After scraping the surface, we soon discover that our millionaire has plans for the three-island archipelago, and they are not luxury facilities for the mere goal of financial benefit. He wants to build a sort of care centre. He is not the Devil after all: he is a philanthropist! And what of Poveglia per Tutti 2 ? Power to the people? Yes, but we first have to define what the people are for the association. Apparently, we are talking about the Venetian people, the locals, the \u201creal inhabitants of Venice\u201d, not the tourists, not the Americano. Poveglia per Tutti is very happy with the way the island is serviced now: it is only accessible by private boat, and therefore not \u201cpolluted\u201d like the rest of Venice. Their agenda is one of preservation. They are not heroes after all: they are conservatives. These two figures are neither good nor evil, they are neither oppressive nor revolted. They are simply weak. A weak capitalist making his measly benefit, fiddling with the no less weaker local associative forces whose only weapons are crowdfunding and demagogy. Redirecting We make one single change. We put a Vaporetto stop on Poveglia e Ottogono. Our archipelago is therefore truly public.

Indeed, it is home to extreme variations in temperature, but most noticeably it hosts one of the most progressive communities in the United States. Could a prototype housing project rely on the particularities of this specific locality to enhance the concept of housing itself? In our view, housing should: allow for minimal disparities in the tenants\u2019 living conditions act as an integral part of the City. In other words: each housing unit should be as equivalent to the others as possible, and the housing project should contribute to the public space. One simple solution is the grid scheme \u2013or so-called Manhattan plan\u2013 where circulation defines housing units. Every unit is surrounded by four \u201cstreets\u201d. However, it is not a very efficient one: distribution takes up a very large portion of the plan and shared space is merely a circulation area. Redirecting We split S-Space equally in the section. 50% of the surface is left for public use, 50% of the elevated floor for housing We decide to make one sacrifice: the view towards the landscape. We admit it is not a mundane feature, but by doing so, we are able to pack the housing units tightly and to enhance the overall project. No views mean no potential differences in Use-Value C-Space is distributed equally in 16 parts. To avoid any kind of disturbance of the plan, any unbalancing of the parcels, access is displaced underneath the living area. We lift up the entire plan, liberating the ground floor for public use . The ground floor is protected by a polycarbonate partition against sand storms After setting the objectives and producing the first sketches, striking similarity appeared between the general design of our project and Ludwig Mies van der Rohe\u2019s Neue Nationalgalerie. We decided to fully assert the resemblance. He had solved every structural problem relating to lifting a great mass without saturating the ground floor with pillars, and we would reuse his strategy, simply using more modest materials and finishing. Our intent is to focus primarily on social enhancement. The formal proximity to a modernist building is simply a testimony to our retreat from optics .","title":"2015 16 Housing units"},{"location":"Case_Studies/2015_00_Swimming_Pool/","text":"cgO3q8dkbIH4ELz83DNwZQ==;iW291GIYhEDTtO7nZYIDL3B0IRQx3UZtfzaupjy609OjKvZriW8zZX/5m7O+AgcHV6RyK84c5o/LcxSJBaejO5th+ODhSgwoGBrkaOxnothKa/0UEiXObuB1YrzBVK8/QPzLDjMXIUiZClrtT5AhblNIayCjqG76/Hlp6psMsyOODRoXYcMac0XA2M+tJf3y+0T04+bdcMjd6PNYQora//vdi7DhNeH98h3gaD5qDHabWekMUJs/D/1Ip9UZxt02D5oNmmxzGBzq1qSWzwWOMquLACyLc6XfUY3QQ2/jOpo=;^","title":"\ud83d\udd12 2015 Swimming Pool"},{"location":"Case_Studies/2015_00_Swimming_Pool/#2015-swimming-pool","text":"eVn5l1tv+yJHvA6wMiklow==;HkYT1oI3CMNbBahAvUAPIdwt/+0IZ0/KoYbjLt2aZnB8MehAv8IrIgeTAvQ+L9HpOpKxJGiklqx59eFq6+ApTXkK39mghYMTu7jhJz0muqq6IFdA2ezlpXDdnGg5e/sPk9sJochV2U4bLpuP29CxtGjt8BGTJkVzQeBcqgLoTWwZFadJ0RrNA1OgG3I0QKiN/WZRQg2oKhLWeZLMwcnT8A==;^","title":"2015 Swimming Pool"},{"location":"Case_Studies/2015_00_Tirana_Park_Entrance/","text":"o76MeyFiM9382yeBRznwiw==;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;^","title":"\ud83d\udd12 2015 Park Entrance"},{"location":"Case_Studies/2015_00_Tirana_Park_Entrance/#2015-park-entrance","text":"Rccfc9Fwl/tvK4939ziWgQ==;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;^","title":"2015 Park Entrance"},{"location":"Case_Studies/2015_00_Tirana_Student_City/","text":"pwE7SjJQ4JqFAFrfh1kd2w==;DgcCx53NF6ncflLkuemJKS1AsrLbo/foczkq0eiEvMo=;^","title":"\ud83d\udd12 2015 Student City"},{"location":"Case_Studies/2015_00_Tirana_Student_City/#2015-student-city","text":"UzvnzEGO8n5JIyO7TwlpDw==;Cv9bIw6mRU6rqsFlxlIs4kjiuu1bAm11rnQQW9hCIpc=;^","title":"2015 Student City"},{"location":"Case_Studies/2015_00_Tirana_Supreme_Court/","text":"fcro7TR2aoN/oEj/9mGxiA==;Ez2j/ozGrP2qVD/2bQkFCKIaV32SZ8kmi2/bYyesjsI=;^","title":"\ud83d\udd12 2015 Supreme Court"},{"location":"Case_Studies/2015_00_Tirana_Supreme_Court/#2015-supreme-court","text":"OJSZanQdyzmrQEqGN8prYw==;9CKgKdTKG02+CuB6Vs0/U4OfreBd0sKFYtdUyK5XYFM=;^","title":"2015 Supreme Court"},{"location":"Case_Studies/2017_00_La_Barre/","text":"Location Orleans Year 2017 Exhibition Architecture Biennale Venue FRAC-Centre Category Exhibition Team Oph\u00e9lie Dozat Text Olivier Surel ## On La barre The high rises of Dogma\u2019s Stop City expressed a formal resistance to a neoliberal dynamic of \u201cinformal urbanization\u201d: eight buildings, each one a constituent element of a \u201chyper-dense archipelago.\u201d Stop City was designed by Dogma as a response to Archizoom\u2019s project No Stop City , which, according to Dogma, was at odds with all utopian projection, and the result of a critique of the capitalist mode of production. For Archizoom, it was a matter of offering a critical precipitate in the form of an architectural exaggeration, by way of a repetition of generic space, much of which can be attributed to the functionality of post-Fordist metropolises \u2013 functions related as much to production as to reproduction. Stop City circumscribed, in architectural design, the critical resource of a limit imposed on neo-liberal urbanization, as well as it veered away from the humanist socialism of utopianism. In technical terms, we can say that such a project constituted a quasi-communitarian and secessionist limit to the subsumption of the social relation under Capital. Beyond Stop City and No Stop City, but in a clear critical relation with Dogma and Archizoom, Max Turnheim\u2019s La Barre figures a generic development of housing projects, in a city where all manifest expression of class conflict has tendentially disappeared, and where architecture tends to become a pure externality of the city\u2019s structuring, a city that has itself become a space of circulation for logistical and informational flows. In this simulation, La Barre\u2019s architecture, inserted amongst a flow modeled according to Navier-Stokes\u2019 equations, is depicted as a zone of active resistance of domestic space. This series, whose appearance tends towards to the diagrammatic, opens to a reflection on the discontinuity of such a space, at a level that ought to be characterized, to borrow a concept from the German-American psychologist Kurt Lewin, as the first sequence of a \u201chodological\u201d rendering of the displacement of high rises in the city center, here reduced to the representation of the linear movement of the flow.

In our optically saturated world, it would be a fundamental mistake to entrust architecture with symbolic efficiency. We will leave the senile naivety of expressive desire to the preceding generation of architects. Architecture\u2019s contemporary role is solely one of partitioning space . Dividing and assembling space constitute the finite set of operations available to us. They are how one reconfigures political structures. Buildings are received in a single manner: by use.

Indeed, formed mainly of single housing units, its atmosphere is far from the ports, the industrial character of the basin or the chaotic urbanity of the big cities. In contrast, the CEC is a materialization of too great of ambitions. Included in Atelier de Montrouge's wider metabolist project, it is its only realized part. In the initial project, the urban expansion of Istres is considered the only plausible or desirable hypothesis. Half a century later, it is clear that the area requires revitalization. When visiting the site, one immediately notices a discrepancy between the multitude of facilities and the low human density of the area. The departure of certain institutions seems to support this discrepancy. Prediction What then are the most likely approaches that seem doomed to failure? Two main actions, cumulative or not, will undoubtedly form the basis of most projects for this site. Given the successive departures of many institutions, and on reading the brief, one primary type of response will emerge: programmatic injection. The teams that adopt this strategy will count on an influx of population that is difficult to guarantee. The excessiveness of such an approach constitutes an economic risk while inferring a potential atmosphere of desolation due to low occupancy. The second type of response will attempt to revive the central street project imagined by the Atelier de Montrouge. These projects will propose a form of soft mobility, certainly coupled with pedestrianization. Such a successful pedestrianization relies on significant commercial activity on the ground floor. Again, the success of such activity depends on a considerable influx of visitors. This influx cannot be guaranteed and also carries a risk. Neither the programmatic injection, the activation of the central street, nor even a combination of the two intentions seems to us to respond to the complexity of the site and its geographical situation. The question then becomes: is there a project that can support the current low human density of the site while having the potential for growth in the number of users? Proposed project The project we propose will be clear, understandable and easily communicable. Political actors, residents as well as users must be able to describe the project with ease. The CEC \"Les Heures claires\" becomes a park. The reason for such a choice seems obvious: the ideal location adjacent to a residential neighbourhood and overlooking the water are just two of the assets that make the site suitable for such a program. Indeed, what other program can live with a few dozen users but also while cultural or sporting events whose appeal resonates beyond the immediate neighbourhood take place? The equipment already present on the site can be activated as users arrive or leave. A park, whose access would not be limited to the daytime, would allow the occupants of the buildings to come and go, day and night, without the risk of sometimes being confronted with the absence of other users. The park project has several layers articulated not only to each other but also to the existing architecture. Existing uses are reinforced, new ones are supported. The Sports Park At the top, a staggered windbreak hedge protects the sports infrastructure from the mistral. A landscaped strip (fitness area, meditation areas, shaded areas, clearings) encourages individual and collective sports and leisure activities to the east. The Park as a Garden The pine forest, the scrubland and the newly created arboretums blend with the buildings. The open spaces of the clearing adjoin the shaded areas with dense vegetation. The cost of such a landscape intervention is low compared to any construction project. Its success is also a less risky bet. The projects we mentioned earlier - the programmatic injection or the activation of the central street - are not incompatible with the park. But the park is an absolute necessity to ensure their proper functioning.","title":"2021 Istres Park"},{"location":"Case_Studies/2021_00_Istres_Park/#2021-istres-park","text":"Location Istres, France Year 2021 Architects UHO, COPA (Silvana De Bari, Valerio Di Festa, Stefania Iraci Sareri) Type International competition Category Urbanism","title":"2021 Istres Park"},{"location":"Case_Studies/2021_00_No_Staff_Club/","text":"AHyVu6P/5y9GN99cQGcYLw==;GdWZyw0Cg/i8fEz4zAPHyh0QNzPrtmiQpnfNL269WuU=;^","title":"\ud83d\udd12 2021 No Staff Club"},{"location":"Case_Studies/2021_00_No_Staff_Club/#2021-no-staff-club","text":"qajHid5djlx/lMWgiRM/MA==;inBCDdyycdk9xoF5pMytqfu8E+JvDxxy+sO6JiGMpFU=;^","title":"2021 No Staff Club"},{"location":"Case_Studies/2021_00_Termoli_Bus_Stops/","text":"2021 Bus stop Year 2021 Location Termoli, Italy Team UHO with Izmade Client Fondazione MACTE Type International open competition Category Urbanism Diagnosis and prediction The call for the competition comes from the Fondazione MACTE, a center for contemporary art. It concerns a bus stop and is open to architects . For centuries, architecture was considered as art. But with the advent of conceptual art and penetration and diversification of new media over the 20th century, strict categories (i.e. sculpture, painting \u2026) dissolved into one general category: art. The side effect of this dissolution is that architecture was pushed out. For better or for worse, the ambition of individual expression for architects through their discipline is a pure gesticulation. Bus stops fall in two broad categories: Bus Stops as Art Commercial (JCDecaux) In both cases, use is collateral. In both cases, the bust stop exists merely as an object to be received optically .

International open competition Category Urbanism Diagnosis and prediction Global recovery by a single mode of production (capitalism) has made governing bodies generally consider public space \u201cactive\u201d when commerce is part of the equation. In a sense, public space (like private space) is not evaluated relative to its use-value, but rather according to its power to enable commercial exchange. The pandemic significantly reinforces this assertion for two reasons: Firstly, outdoor interactions present a lesser risk of contagion. Secondly, when most traditional social contracts integrate the presumption of innocence as a foundation, the new conditions we are under present a rupture of this very concept: we are under the presumption of illness. As a consequence, we face a contradictory injunction: leave the domestic sphere but stay hyper-vigilant. This paranoid state equates to the complete internalization of capitalist relations. Redirection While Vienna is famous for the care given to public space in its most touristic areas (generating a profit for the city), we propose to act on two types of spaces: Public spaces which were historically bound to commerce, like markets and storefronts. Public spaces that have had little to no investment and where commerce has sometimes emerged organically, often in its underground form. Our project consists of outdoor furniture covered with marks every 20 cm. While they could serve as an objective measure of social distance, we leave their use to the users' discretion. We do not doubt that public space is successful when hosting a combination of use and misuse, not entirely conditional to firm ownership, and where habits can form.","title":"2021 Possibilities of space"},{"location":"Case_Studies/2021_00_Vienna_Possibilities_of_space/#2021-possibilities-of-space","text":"Year 2021 Location Vienna, Austria Client Catalogue of Possibilities Type International open competition Category Urbanism","title":"2021 Possibilities of space"},{"location":"Method/010_About_Space/","text":"About Space Too often, architects jump into work without understanding what taking action in a specified context implies. In the following few lines, we will try to convince you first of the use of a precise terminology and will start to give a few definitions of terms. For architects , the word Space is central. Its importance is probably due to the fact that there is no generally accepted definition of the term. In what follows, we will propose an explanation, one we would love for a broader audience to discuss and hopefully come to an agreement around. Let us start with our short definition. Space is the compound of 3 components : C-Space (Space as a commodity ) P-Space (Physical Space) S-Space (Social Space) It is not more complicated than this, but if we do accept this initial statement, consequences are serious. Space is the product of human labor and can be exchanged on the market. Space can be seen or touched, or more generally perceived through our senses. Space hosts, produces and is shaped by relations. We also consider that the three components of Space overlap as shown in the following diagram: To further extend the definitions of our 3 components , let us look at their 1-to-1 intersections: The intersection of C-Space & P-Space enables extraction . The intersection of C-Space & S-Space enables exploitation . The intersection of P-Space & S-Space enables exploration . We can see quite evidently that where Space is considered a commodity , we see emerge possibilities that we would deem negative. On the contrary, in a hypothetical scenario where this component would have disappeared, we would see an emancipatory horizon show. Absolute scenarios like these will not be investigated further here, we consider the state of the world to be presently under the conditions of Late Capitalism. Our intent is to facilitate action under these conditions rather than to imagine an alternate realities. Lastly, depending on our position on this map of Space (the diagram aforementioned), we acquire and abandon different roles: architect , user, client, investor, renter, etc. With these roles come possibilities of action and incentives. It is mainly these incentives which pressure individuals into consolidating the current balance of power. The first step to shifting this balance is to understand what Space we are inhabiting.","title":"About Space"},{"location":"Method/010_About_Space/#about-space","text":"Too often, architects jump into work without understanding what taking action in a specified context implies.

In what follows, we will propose an explanation, one we would love for a broader audience to discuss and hopefully come to an agreement around. Let us start with our short definition. Space is the compound of 3 components : C-Space (Space as a commodity ) P-Space (Physical Space) S-Space (Social Space) It is not more complicated than this, but if we do accept this initial statement, consequences are serious. Space is the product of human labor and can be exchanged on the market. Space can be seen or touched, or more generally perceived through our senses. Space hosts, produces and is shaped by relations. We also consider that the three components of Space overlap as shown in the following diagram: To further extend the definitions of our 3 components , let us look at their 1-to-1 intersections: The intersection of C-Space & P-Space enables extraction . The intersection of C-Space & S-Space enables exploitation . The intersection of P-Space & S-Space enables exploration . We can see quite evidently that where Space is considered a commodity , we see emerge possibilities that we would deem negative. On the contrary, in a hypothetical scenario where this component would have disappeared, we would see an emancipatory horizon show. Absolute scenarios like these will not be investigated further here, we consider the state of the world to be presently under the conditions of Late Capitalism. Our intent is to facilitate action under these conditions rather than to imagine an alternate realities. Lastly, depending on our position on this map of Space (the diagram aforementioned), we acquire and abandon different roles: architect , user, client, investor, renter, etc. With these roles come possibilities of action and incentives. It is mainly these incentives which pressure individuals into consolidating the current balance of power. The first step to shifting this balance is to understand what Space we are inhabiting.","title":"About Space"},{"location":"Method/011_Practical_Methodology/","text":"In Practice Every case study follows a three-step process. Case studies (or projects) all start with a careful analysis of the context, follow through with a phase of prediction of alternative proposals and conclude with a redirection. Diagnosis Every Project starts with a critical analysis of its Context . It is important to state that Context is rarely understood as purely positive. There is no objective to fit into the Context : if the Context is satisfactory, there is no reason to intervene. Anticipation of Failures The practice of Architecture must be separated of its self-serving impulse. The modification of existing Space must be justified by an increase of its Use-Value . The first question thus becomes: what would have happened without our intervention? Whether the Site is left untouched or another Architect designs a Project , is the Outcome satisfactory? If we deem it \u201csatisfactory\u201d, there is no reason for intervention. If and only if we deem it \u201cunsatisfactory\u201d is there a justification for us to address it through design. To predict the Outcome requires understanding which pressures are applied to the Site and to try to map the direction of the Deterministic_path of the Project . Redirection A project is always an act of redirection. If during the prediction phase, the outcome is satisfactory, there is no need for a project. If, on the contrary, the outcome is unsatisfactory, the architect can employ one or several of strategies to redirect the outcome . One way of redirecting is a reordering of the Priority_Stack","title":"In Practice"},{"location":"Method/011_Practical_Methodology/#in-practice","text":"Every case study follows a three-step process.

In 1986 UNESCO added the site to the World Heritage List and the Greek Ministry of Culture started the restoration of the ruined temple of Bassae Apollo Epicurius, the site has been covered by a large white tent and earthquake-proof scaffolding. In the aftermath of the debt crisis that hit Greece in 2009, work there ground to a halt and the restoration structure itself was exposed to decay. Bassae Bassae, a film directed by Fabien Giraud and Rapha\u00ebl Siboni in 2014, is about this doubled ruin. In a rigorous remake of Pollet\u2019s original movie, it shows the temple in its present state, revealing the overlapping of the restoration\u2019s failure with its own collapsed architecture. Of these two films, we will say nothing more here. We simply wanted to use their production dates as the historical boundaries of what can be considered as a true phase-change in our conception of space. This essay attempts to evoke the emergence over the last fifty years of what can be called an \u201cecological spatiality\u201d. By problematizing both the epistemic consequences (the naming of things) and the political consequences (action upon things) of this concept, we would like to attempt to reformulate a simple question of architecture: Within which and for which space do we build? I. The Space of Gods Alain Badiou\u2019s explication of the three consecutive deaths of God 1 , evolutionary relationship to the infinite, can be perceived as a history of spatial collapses. From this perspective, the God of Religion, the God of Metaphysics and the God of Poets that Badiou identifies as the three sequential phenomena of this evolution must be seen as successive models wherein mankind\u2019s relationship to his environment is spatialized in a totalizing order. Each god is a construction that enabled us both to establish meaningful connections within the infinite array of worldly events and forms and to define a mode of conduct according to the ordered distribution that resulted from this. As such, the spatial \u201cmodel of god\u201d has two aspects: it serves to name relations, and it enables action within them. It is precisely the development over time of this link between naming and acting, and of the spatialities resulting from the tension that arises between these two elements, that constitutes the sequences of Badiou\u2019s history: The God of Religion is the god with whom we have to live and negotiate for our lives. It is a living god, in so far as our existence in this world is constantly exposed to the possibility of an encounter with him. The model it yields is centred around the advent of this relationship. Its spatiality is a relational one. The God of Metaphysics is the god who brings relations into the world while remaining outside of them. He is the \u201csupreme immobile mover\u201d, both the origin and vanishing point of all physical activity. We cannot expect to encounter such a god; there can be no exchange with him. We can only hope to approach and reveal the truth of his unilateral giving: he is the one who contains while being contained by nothing other than himself. He thus embodies the notion of an absolute spatiality. The God of Poets, in contrast, is neither relational nor absolute. The space he engenders is not one of proximity, nor is it one of severed totality. He is the god of Ho\u0308lderlin, the withdrawn god whose impossible return can only be performed through the Poem. He is the god of Heidegger whose absence is revealed by the promise of him coming back, the one Heidegger referred to in his famous televised statement \u201cOnly a god can save us.\u201d This model, whose primary traits are loss and nostalgia, aporia and awaiting, is characterized by an exiled spatiality. As models of relational, absolute and exiled spatialities, we can easily admit that these three gods have experienced irreversible deaths. There is no living entity with whom to negotiate our place in the world; there is no outside principle giving sense to its movement; there is no language that could enable their return. If for Badiou the task of philosophy is to unfold the consequences of these deaths as much as to think beyond them, then the task of architecture can be perceived as that of modelling and building upon the ruins of the gods\u2019 collapsed spatialities. The most direct consequence of this triple collapse is the advent of a new type of space. Negatively defined as what remains when all gods and totalizing orders have fully withdrawn from the scene, the generic designation of this space is a radical \u201chere\u201d. What we now need to do is reveal the model of this \u201chere\u201d, where no subject can safeguard relations, where no superior order can contain movements and where no words can fill the absence. If \u201chere\u201d is the place that results from the collapse of all totalities, and if its emergence negates the very possibility of all- encompassing spatial models, then the question that remains is this: how can we posit an orderly interrelationship between the naming of space and action within it that is adequate to the new conditions with which this \u201chere\u201d presents us? In the discussion that follows, we will try to address how ecology has emerged as a historical response to this question by establishing itself as a model that enables us to name the \u201chere\u201d in a specific way and to act within and upon it. Furthermore, by briefly identifying different architectural approaches to the kind of spatiality ecology has engendered, we would like to provide a sketch of a model of ecology suited to the requirements of our present \u201chere\u201d. II. The Space of Ecology The deaths of Badiou\u2019s three gods and the landscape they bequeathed us provided the fertile ground of postmodernity. By both prolonging and dramatizing the collapse of these models, postmodernity has cultivated a terrain of suspicion where all totalizing attempts and narratives are thrown into crisis; this terrain is infused with a general skepticism that, in its weakest yet most influential form, has found resolution in the realm of anecdote and the sorrow of \u201carchivism\u201d. It was against this \u201cparalysis of thought\u201d \u2013 whose main expression is falsely modest cultural relativism \u2013 and against the taboo regarding any confrontation with immeasurableness that a particular idea of ecology emerged at the end of the 1980s. The most prominent figures of this conceptual turn have been Peter Sloterdijk and Bruno Latour. Sloterdijk\u2019s and Latour\u2019s respective theories of spheres and networks are similar attempts to reestablish the model in the unmodelizable fragmented landscape of the postmodernists. With his spherology , Sloterdijk has replaced history with a morphology of inhabitable spaces, while Latour, through his actor\u2013network theory , has replaced nature with the infinite intermeshing of objects and subjects. Setting aside the notable differences between these theories, both nonetheless endorse a similar position on the question of space. For Sloterdijk, history is not that which happens in a space, but that which produces spaces. For Latour, entities do not exist within a space, but rather engender their own spaces through the composition of their movements. It is precisely this shared perception of the reversal of the relationship of a space with its constitutive components that we would like to call an \u201cecological spatiality\u201d. So what are the main features of such a spatiality? Its foundation is the affirmation that all of the problems pertaining to the modernists\u2019 order and the crisis that followed in their wake can only be resolved through a change in geometry from a containing space to a flattened one. If the collisions of social order and natural order \u2013 of subjects and objects \u2013 seem to have generated unsolvable problems that we are obliged to face, then this is merely due to the inadequacy of our spatial models in addressing these collisions. Following what Jean Cavaille\u0300s identified as the process of the \u201ctrimming of the extrinsic\u201d in modern mathematics, the radical constructivism of ecological spatiality could be said to extend this movement into an ever more intrinsic conception of space. It is only once space has been freed from any notion of \u201cexterior\u201d and \u201ccontainment\u201d, and only once all entities have been released from their referential frame and all things have been \u201cflattened onto\u201d the infinite manifold of relations that a true ecology \u2013 understood as a logic of habitation \u2013 can be articulated. What follows from this geometric thesis is an ontological one. Ecology, according to this paradigmatic spatial shift, is a commitment to the reversal of the relationship between Being and beings. Its philosophy \u2013 referred to as Relationist Ontology \u2013 is one in which the depth of Being emerges from the superficial relations between beings . This thesis is best exemplified in the imaginary question Peter Sloterdijk once addressed to Martin Heidegger: \u201cWhen you say that Dasein is thrown into the world, where is it thrown? What\u2019s the temperature there? The colours of the walls, the material that has been chosen, the technology for disposing of refuse, the cost of the air-conditioning, and so on?\u201d 2 With regard to this ecological spatiality, we would argue that the two polarizing figures of contemporary architecture are Patrik Schumacher and Pier Vittorio Aureli. By evoking their theoretical endorsement and practical development of two seemingly radically opposed strategies, we want to consider them, despite the risk of caricature, as two schematic figures in the diagram of the present. Schumacher has been Zaha Hadid\u2019s partner since 1988. He has taken Hadid\u2019s gesture of \u201clanding\u201d the modernists\u2019 lifted mass \u2013 the idea of connecting design intentions to the specifics of the territory they address \u2013 to a radically further point. While the early architectural projects of Hadid\u2019s practice seemed merely to address the interaction of built mass with its surroundings, its current projects aim to structurally infuse their context. The idea is to recognize the current communication-driven free market as an operative social structure in which the goal of architecture is to build analogous environments through an intensely interconnected set of subsystems, thereby resulting in the continuous spatiality of the \u201cglobal urban field logic\u201d. To use a geographic metaphor, Schumacher\u2019s strategy is one that cannot be fulfilled with the mere act of landing ; rather, it requires one of flooding the context through a constant management and acceleration of its relations: \u201cGive me any collage of unrelated elements and I can generate connections and resonances, invent correlations. So I reject the pure interruption, the pure discontinuity.\u201d 3 Pier Vittorio Aureli, as a counterpart, perceives Patrik Schumacher\u2019s prophecy as an already realized one: Cerda\u0300\u2019s urbanizacio\u0301n is already the state of the current world \u2013 its flooding has already happened and its engulfment in the aqueous milieu of capitalism has long been realized. Contrary to this formal liquefaction, which he perceives as complicit in the dynamics of neo- liberalism, Aureli conceives of the act of building as one that no longer operates through smooth transitions but rather as cuts in the field of relations. In an architectural project he himself defines as an equation of the political with the formal, the question of the notion of the limit becomes central. It is by defining a limit (or by recognizing and emphasizing an existing one) that he is able to generate an autonomous territory, one capable of withdrawing from any interaction with its surrounding spatiality. Autonomy from the surroundings is Aureli\u2019s project: In this way, absolute architecture as a finite form is not simply the tautological claim of its literal object; it is also the example for a city no longer driven by the ethos of expansion and inclusion but by the positive idea of limits and confrontation. By clearly exposing their limits, architectural parts confront each other and form an agonistic plurality, becoming a site where judgment through difference is again possible. 4 Of these two models \u2013 one relational, one disruptive \u2013 we can identify the risks inherent to their positioning with regard to ecological spatiality. If we admit that the name we have given to the space of our time is Relationist Ontology, then problems arise when one tries to identify the kind of action they would propose in its \u201cflattened\u201d landscape. In Schumacher\u2019s model, we can identify his concept of action as that of preserving \u2013 at any cost and, most notably, by voluntarily blinding himself to the socio-political consequences of his constructions \u2013 the dynamics of relations and the inherent creativity of his generative system. In Aureli\u2019s model, we can describe its logic of disruption as that of a pure re-action , one that runs the risk of reaffirming pre-constituted social orders. Through this voluntarily nai\u0308ve reading of the two architects\u2019 respective projects, what we are left with are two competitive types of action upon the named space of ecology. In one, we have a conservative model according to which to act is to preserve the naming of space. In the other, we have a reactionary model in which to act is to negate the naming of space. These attempts, defined respectively by dialectics of conservation and reaction, both essentialize relations and absolutize confrontation. In doing so, they also both re-establish pre-existing spatialities we thought had long since disappeared. In Schumacher\u2019s work, the relational model of the living god is revealed in its updated and digitized form. The all-encompassing computational paradigm it embraces limits the world\u2019s possibilities to the movements of the \u201cdiscrete engine\u201d, making the latter the obscure subject of relations. A similar critique could be made of Aureli\u2019s approach. Indeed, the endorsement of the absolute (in the sense of the \u201csevered\u201d and the radically \u201cun-linked\u201d) as the foundation of his project could be read as reintroducing a distinctive order \u2013 an incommensurable exterior space \u2013 into the continuous plane of relations. As a result, both of these models remain bound to an extrinsic definition of space and are thus inherently inadequate ones in relation to ecological spatiality. III. The Space of Emancipation Opposed to these two recognized dead ends with regard to the kind of action to be taken in the context of an ecological spatiality, what we need is an emancipatory model \u2013 a model which, once freed from the incessant duality of conservation and confrontation, posits an action within relations that is capable of transforming the very name we have given them. It is only through a further descent into the intrinsic that such an emancipatory model can be articulated. Conceived in its political sense, an emancipatory model consists in an exceeding of the boundaries of the realm of what is \u201cpossible\u201d. It is an ampliative model, in so far as the outcome of its actions not only exceeds its premises, but also constantly reconfigures the very constitutive correlation between naming \u201cthe possible\u201d and acting upon it. Contrary to this constant deracination of the model by itself, Schumacher\u2019s practice is merely the expression of a \u201cphase portrait\u201d of given sets of possibilities. The spatiality that results from his architectural model is simply the totality of all possible becomings within the clearly defined boundaries of his relational methodology. In defining things this way, he attributes an identity to \u201cthe possible\u201d and then merely limits its range to systemic conservation, thus remaining inherently bound to a conservative model. We could argue that Aureli opposes the image of the flood that served as the most accurate analogy for Schumacher\u2019s project with that of the dam . A dam is not simply a cut in a river; it is also a device of differentiation. This differentiation operates on two distinct levels: firstly, as a purely quantitative pressure difference between the contained and released water; and secondly, as a fully qualitative change when this pressure difference is transformed into electricity. On the one hand, we have differences in degrees , and on the other, differences in kind . While Schumacher is doomed to the vain wanderings of conservative gesticulations, the metaphor of the dam allows us to rescue Aureli from the reactionary pitfall to which we have rhetorically subjected him. Opposing the definition of the cut \u2013 as that which re-establishes an impossible exteriority to the realm of relations \u2013 the dam enables the possibility of a fully intrinsic and operative discontinuity. The dam is an embedded blockage \u2013 not an act of secession \u2013 which, by opposing its mass to the flow of the river, not only prevents the flooding of the landscape, but also engenders a whole new set of possibilities \u2013 a fundamentally different spatiality, regardless of which side of the dam it is observed from. The act of producing a discontinuity goes beyond enclosing a space and producing its dual outside; it is not a mere binary partition of the plane, but an act of creation. By the mere existence of discontinuity, continuity \u2013 here understood as the ordered relation of parts to whole \u2013 is simultaneously disrupted and redistributed in a new and unpredictable structure. Contrary to the purely quantitative emergence of parametric models, discontinuity operates on the very structure of the spatiality within which it appears. Through its actions, it potentially modifies space to the point where the very model becomes inadequate. With this qualitative \u201cphase change\u201d in the model itself, it is the very binding of naming and acting which undergoes transformation. This autocatalysis of the model \u2013 whereby every act within the space of possibilities feeds back into the very name given to \u201cthe possible\u201d \u2013 unfolds as a constant emancipation from all identities. In light of this analogy, the very notion of the absolute , which we previously identified with the reactionary model, could take on a completely new meaning, one that fully discards the absolute of territorial confrontations and secessionist logics in favour of the possibility of an intrinsic absolute . Aureli\u2019s project, once fully embedded in a radically intrinsic spatiality, effects a shift from an architectural model of continuity to one of contiguity. It becomes a praxis of the border, a production of spaces through transformative acts of bordering . The possibility of an intrinsic \u201cabsolute architecture\u201d is that of a commitment to the constant deracination of our \u201chere\u201d. By performatively defining this \u201chere\u201d as a truly generic and undifferentiated continuum of pure possibilities in which there is nothing to sustain, preserve, compose or nurture, and in which there is nothing to detach from and nowhere to go back to, it proposes a model of ecology as a method for severing and thus absolutizing \u201cthe possible\u201d from any binding identity.

Struck by the financial crisis of 2008 and with scarce commissions, members of this community have started wandering far away from their core interests into not so unfamiliar territories such as anthropology, social activism and \u2018politics\u2019. Let us clarify why we consider these territories to be familiar: our generational predecessors, struck by the impossibility of pursuing the Modern project, had already unsuccessfully experimented with this exploration; they were the postmodernists. Despite their good will, any attempt they made was instantly consumed by capitalism . Alongside the disorientation that the postmodernists were affected by, they also made a taboo out of anything that could have a remotely universalist ambition, (which obviously was not the most efficient strategy for addressing an increasingly well-connected world). The discipline of Architecture is concerned with the partitioning of space . If there is a single point we would like to get across it has to be this one. That is not to say that one should not be concerned with politics, but on the contrary the only way for us to have credibility is to tackle this matter from the locus of space partitioning . Nevertheless, this cannot be done without an understanding of the technological shift we are traversing. Two fundamental changes related to the fourth industrial revolution await us: on the one side, these changes concern production and on the other the evolution of our bodies. We will see that both relate to what we might think of as ownership and boundaries. The capitalist rulebook tells us that if you work hard, you will be financially successful. There is a supposed clear relationship between labour and the revenue it generates for the individual participant in this contractual exchange. Having gathered surplus revenue, the individual is then able to invest, letting capital generate its own revenue. Let us now consider a world where labour is uncompetitive in comparison to machine work. We are left with two classes: one possessing the means of production (machine owners) and one absolutely incapable of generating revenue (surplus populations). We must also acknowledge the potential existence of a third class: the operators. The operators maintain and program the machines. But it is quite clear that this class\u2019 existence is only financially justified if its demographics stay small and dwindle in a predictable manner. The result is the emergence of a breed of super-financial-humans and the dying out of useless non-workers. Two inactive classes devoid of social mobility. Concerning our bodies, they are already changing. Over the last couple of decades, we have unanimously embraced prosthetic appendixes in the form of our phones. This might sound like an exaggeration (or worse a banality) but simply imagine going a few hours without your prosthesis or having someone grab it and accessing the data it contains, texting or posting from your identity. The soft violence this would constitute confirms the fact that you have grafted, or included in your cognitive scaffolding, a foreign object. This object is obviously foreign for several reasons, but the one we are interested in is the fact that it is owned by an external entity. Of course, you bought your phone: you own it. But it is virtually dead if it doesn\u2019t have access to its own infrastructure (a data-network). This infrastructure must be considered as a coherent body, with its own physicality: a physicality that extends inside of you. While this relationship could be seen as symbiotic, we must understand that this is a relatively new thing and its consequences are not yet well understood. A wooden leg or a glass eye belong to you; their physicality is entirely contained within the boundaries of what you consider your active body proper. These new prosthetic devices cannot be simplified into diagrams according to a scheme of mere alteration (like older prosthetic forms) but must be represented as intersections: they materialize the shared space between our individual bodies and the great data-network body. More than ever, architecture is necessary as the discipline capable of addressing the shift affecting these boundaries. Indeed, regarding our first point, it seems unviable for humanity to proceed with a technological evolution without equally redistributing the fruits of machine work. It is essential that we construct a new way of partitioning space to claim the territories that machines operate in (factories, data centers and communication infrastructures, roads, fields\u2026) as public domains. Secondly and without any nostalgia or reactionary position (there is no way back, nor a desire of a world without global interconnectivity), we must understand the spatial reconfiguration of our bodies proper as intersecting with a body of data. This other body is furthermore to be claimed as a political body, and it cannot remain an economic asset to a handful of corporations.","title":"2017 Architecture will divide us"},{"location":"Publications/Published/2020_Firmament/","text":"i5BXq7OtidqJ4sR1NZMdCg==;5uYDlac1Flplxxm1Z2ICuInDGQ9EsWBMmBie9RS1Hzs=;^","title":"\ud83d\udd12 Firmament"},{"location":"Publications/Published/2020_Firmament/#firmament","text":"sGInY/FTfsnPP+1WyqNJQg==;ZVvolwDDcWfTRyDxbE11+9NSKy47FjazPtZ3mNUDEV8=;^","title":"Firmament"},{"location":"Publications/Published/2020_Oval_Review/","text":"Q01XtHolzFyPEi/HvG9vog==;W3LWlJqJDQ1xwF5ZL1q6TRoCziA4sEdII98czArekvE=;^","title":"\ud83d\udd12 2020 Oval Review"},{"location":"Publications/Published/2021_Below_the_Shadows/","text":"8Y8XUcrRExIar1vKaF3TWA==;hgLaByKzLik+IIKdnCf5HY6dM0mC0pcL4o3FrPdRGRg=;^","title":"\ud83d\udd12 2021 Below the Shadows"},{"location":"Publications/Published/2021_Poseur_Real_Estate/","text":"WvXIbr1wtCIj5YYJaOfdJA==;mwKNPM2VDXffI9GXJgYLFt4Ajlt0XJA1E7tfpXuGenY=;^","title":"\ud83d\udd12 2021 Poseur Real Estate"},{"location":"Publications/Published/2021_The_Beach_is_Boring/","text":"JE7bva+aJoz8RpJ+4RjKMg==;5WycURUOzRsi9Ybh1aZG8LU1Hmiud1Yp/qBCWx29Qo8=;^","title":"\ud83d\udd12 2021 The Beach is Boring"},{"location":"Publications/Published/2022_Optical_Tactile/","text":"2022 Optical or tactile Author UHO; Federico Coricelli and Max Turnheim Publication STO\u00c0 #3 Year 2022 Optical or tactile. Architecture\u2019s failure to store and distribute information UHO\u2013Max Turnheim and Federico Coricelli interviewed by Marianna Ascolese In contemporary society, the image plays a decisive role in the perception of architecture and the approach to re- ality. In the pedagogical approach, the position of draw- ings, models, and renderings is a constant and still-open debate. It also displays a continuous interaction between craft and digital making. However, today\u2019s architectur- al culture produces refined and spectacular images that bring together different and integrated worlds, digital and artisanal ones. The conversation with Max Turn- heim and Federico Coricelli \u2013 founders of the UHO stu- dio in 2013 \u2013 explores the multiple aspects of rendering in academic and professional contexts and investigates how the social and political frame could influence the perception and the production of the images in the ar- chitectural design. Producing images depicts both the expression of investigative values of the space and the identification of a commercial tool. Constructing im- ages represents the basis of the pedagogical research in the design process, a technique that requires time and the ability to mature individual cultural experiences. Absorbing images needs a precise distance between the primary trends of the society and the theoretical aware- ness of each student. Renderings are \u2013 and will be \u2013 part of this investigation that touches both the digital and virtual worlds and belong to the design process in ar- chitectural education. Although the digital culture con- tinues to develop, architectural students need to explore the physical and tactile body of architecture. Daniel Swarovski. INT 12. 2019-20 Marianna Ascolese: Our society is predominantly retinal; it entrusts the eye with the ability to observe and understand reality. In this context Walter Benjamin\u2019s contrast between touch and sight is explicit, the two senses that in different ways influence the perception of architectural space. Do you think it is possible to recognize a rendering as an autonomous tool, like drawings or models? In your opinion, what role does the render play in architectural design education? Max Turnheim: It is important to understand in current times that the tactile and optical dichotomy enunciat- ed by Benjamin 1 to the period ranging from the early 18th century to the late 19th century in France, where readership penetrated the population. It goes from almost completely analpha- bet to almost totally literate. The consequence was that the storage and distribution of information started to use much more efficient means than architecture. Until then, architecture was a major means of storage and dis- tribution of information \u2013 think of religious buildings. The question ported to the written medium or the book. From that moment up until now, this type of transfor- mation has happened multiple times. We have devices that are much more powerful and much more efficient in the storage and distribution of data or information. This means that architecture is incapable of competing on the optical level, so this aspect, the optical part, must be abandoned as a priority. The most autonomous rep- resentation tool addressing the tactile aspect \u2013 whether you bump into a wall or not \u2013 is the plan, there is no equivalent. It is the most important tool of represen- tation of the partition of space, simply because it rep- resents constrained navigation. The only thing that a render can provide is the atmospheric interpretation of the space to come. The plan is the object of navigation, it is an active document. The render itself is always used as an image of the absence of the user. If you look at our renders, there is almost never a character, and it seems as if they just left the scene, so it is a 3D of the absence of a user inside of space, a reference to its potential presence, the presentation of the absent. Federico Coricelli: Ten years ago, when Pier Vittorio Aureli reintroduced the idea of the autonomy of the discipline with books as The Project of Autonomy 2 , it had a direct impact on student\u2019s drawings. What followed was a period of mannerism of collages and Egyptian perspectives. In architectural schools, renderings where temporarily abandoned. Then students have the capaci- ty to make obsolete new things very quickly by means of copying and iterating. The same collage repeated times and times again ends, exhausting the mean of represen- tation. It took only few years for renderings to come back. I believe what became now an autonomous field for students is the translation of the Beaux-Art virtuoso into renderings. MT: Architecture is work. This is very important be- cause it is always defined as a pleasurable activity and ar- tistic discipline. Not at all. It is work that transforms and commodifies space. In that sense, once it is a commodity there is a huge value attached, a desire, if not a need, for the object that can be expressed through the image. It is a perverse relationship to the object or the image, in one sense, and on the other side it is a pleasurable counterbalance to the difficult ascetic work of drawing plans for the students. In the pedagogical context, the deal is: you learn to partition space, and on the other side you can have fun with the atmospheric images. In the market of architecture, it is an essential communica- tion tool for the buyer of the commodity, so to be able to sell the product of space as commodity you need to have these images, but it is a dirty object in terms of its political purity. FC: If you take a photo of a physical model, it attempts as well to embed an artisanal labour value in the im- age. Somehow, the quest for the benjaminian aura of a non-replicable object \u2013 a non-rendering \u2013, is fuelled by the will to escape the banality of commercial renderings. In the professional world, if you want to sell a project with an image you don\u2019t need something sophisticated, you need to stimulate desire, and you can make it quickly. When the task is translated into architectural pedagogy, I think it meets the impossible quest of architecture to slow down the pace, to try to make models in plaster and spend maybe one month to learn the technique, and then to take a picture of it and to think about this as a form of resistance to the market... Aida Aghayeva. INT 12. 2019-20 MA: Both of you operate in cultural contexts where the role of the representation of the architectural project has been relevant for the communicative process. Both the Italian school (from Aldo Rossi, Massimo Scolari to Superstudio and Archizoom) and the English tradition (from Archigram to Dogma) have experimented with drawing and collage as instruments of representation capable of communicating a precise idea of architecture. In your opinion, what could be contemporary references to look at useful for the students? FC: For the Italian tradition, the radicals from Florence \u2013 where I graduated \u2013 represent a quite a new history, especially for the students. During the 1980s and the 1990s, up to the early 2000s, the radical neo-avantgardes of the 1960s were not so cool in architecture schools. Then you start to have the Biennale in 2014, the exhi- bition at PAC in Milan and at MAXXI in 2016, Palazzo Strozzi in 2017, and in Brussels last year 3 , just to men- tion a few, and their work was completely reconsidered. This is not surprising, because a lot of the radical ideas of these groups were the main causes of their dissolution in the mid-1970s, because the response of the market was actually enthusiastic to something conceived as a critique. Today, the time for historization of radical ar- chitecture has passed, and the theory becomes entirely distilled by the collages that we all know. It\u2019s difficult to see this in a linear way, it is more like something that at some point jumps from forty or fifty years before and becomes the new normal. MT: The UK still functions as a flavor of monarchy. It is a strange thing from a French perspective, the English have not gone through any revolution, it doesn\u2019t exist in the popular mythology of the UK. What does this produce in terms of education in the UK? In the recent years, even public institutions have tuition fees that have gone through the roof. This lets the so called com- petitivity enter the context of research, and this must be a competitive context. What you notice in architecture schools in the UK, is that everything must be special, singular, the work must be innovative. The betterment of space is not a requirement. It becomes a completely secondary question. The main one is: has it been done before? \u00abIs it disruptive?\u00bb as they would say in the tech industry. FC: I\u2019ll try to answer straightforward the question with two answers. The first one is what Mies van der Rohe suggested when they awarded him the Royal Gold Med- al in 1959: \u00abLearned most from old buildings\u00bb 4 . This was a statement on a flash card he was carrying that day, that I believe in its simplicity can\u2019t be avoided by any short- cut or innovative study plan. In order to find references, specifically for architectural drawings, you need to have a geography of knowledge to navigate through. The sec- ond one is probably on the impossibility or the difficulty to express categorically some contemporary authors, because individuality is no more the leading value in any cultural domain. From fashion to music, it is all about collaborations, and contemporary architecture follows suit, so it becomes really a project-dependant and a con- text-dependant question. Plus, there is another obstacle. What students want to imitate is not a building, but a drawing. On the other hand, to understand architecture you need to interact physically with it. ![[EX_12_ALEJANDRO_DEL_CASTILLO 1.png]] Alejandro del Castillo. INT 12. 2019-20 MA: Looking at your work I was very impressed by the title you gave to the last unit at the AA in London, Low-def space in which you try to understand the impact that digital pro- cesses have in the definition of inhabited spaces. This idea of low-def space translates in contemporary times into spaces that are less and less defined for their capability of adapting to new uses; this clashes with the considerable amount of data used to build digital models in which the question of scale of representation and definition of detail is removed. So, how do renderings manage the figuration of the complexity of these inhabited spaces? MT: When we picked this title with Emma Isdahl and Taneli Mansikkama\u0308ki the question was: What is a space which has low definition? There is zero or very little function attached to it, but there is high use. The objec- tive, at least \u2013 I don\u2019t know if we will get there by the end of the year \u2013 is to explore space that can be qualified out- side of its function. I think the relationship to rendering is twofold, one is an exercise for students able to manip- ulate these tools, second it is the possibility to have an apprehension of the space that they are designing with immediate testing dimensions. To hint at this other ob- ject, which is outside of architecture, it is a simulation in which we will be immersed. It is inevitable, but it will raise a lot of questions, in terms of ownership of what is left behind, because when we talk about architecture, we address the distribution of the ownership of space. I think it\u2019s interesting to prophesize (and believe) that something will become less. Architects do prophesize: think of Archizoom\u2019s No-Stop City, where they predict a totally homogeneous space in which we are reduced to pure producers/consumers of commodities at every given location. In their case, the prophecy is realised. Rendering has a place there that is not a heroic or weak place, it is just there and cannot go away: simulation of space will become an integral part of space. Maybe one aspect we haven\u2019t mentioned too much is the real time rendering (Raytraced VR) because of the archaic nature of architectural drawings. But the fundamental change is going to be an accessible real time believable simu- lation. This will be extremely strange, it will be some- thing which fundamentally modifies the perception of these alternative worlds, they will be perceived as reali- ty, they will be a part of reality, not a broken off object, but something that will be embedded simply because we will not be able to not believe them. But architecture will still, and even more, be about the other, tactile part.
